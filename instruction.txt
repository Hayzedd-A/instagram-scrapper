I want to build an instagram scrapper using apify. 
The app is for a content creator to easily get to know all posted videos about a specific topic and to make some personal decision. 
The flow of the app is that, the frontend sends a query like: the search term, the recency, min views, min followers and then the app should return all neccessary data including the captions.
frontend sample request
{
  searchTerm: string,
  recencyDays: number,
  minViews: number,
  minFollowers: number,
  profile: {
    recencyPost: number,
  }
}


Step 1 — Frontend creates job
POST /api/instagram/search


Backend:

Validate input
Create DB job record
Start Apify actor
Store runId internally

Return:

{
  "jobId": "internal_job_id",
  "status": "PROCESSING"
}

Step 2 — Backend handles Apify fully

Backend:

Poll Apify run

When finished:
Fetch dataset
Filter
Normalize
Save result in DB
Update job status to SUCCESS


Step 3 — Frontend polls backend
GET /api/instagram/job/:jobId


Response:

{
  "status": "PROCESSING"
}


or

{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "data": [...]
}
